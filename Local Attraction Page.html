      <h2 id="Eiffel">Eiffel Tower</h2>
      <p>Construction of the Eiffel Tower began on July 1, 1887 and was finished almost 2 years later. A competition
        was organized for the best plans to build an iron tower with a square base, 125 meters wide and 300 meters high.
        Of all the 107 plans submitted, Gustave Eiffel's plan was chosen. Despite opposition to the construction,
        the tower was built to commemorate the 100th year of the France Revolution with the plans for it to be demolished
        20 years after. However, it soon became the symbol of French industrial power and eventually used a radio
        antenna to prevent its destruction. That antenna caused it to be 1063 feet tall and the towermade with latticed
        wrought iron</p>

      <h2 id="Notre">Notre Dame Cathederal</h2>
      <p>Construction beginning back during the 12th century in 1160, this cathederal was rebuilt in place of a old cathederal
        as a momument to the Virgin Mary. Stone by stone, it took until 1345 for the Cathederal to be complete. The building
        itself would stand the test of time as the centuries wane. Numerous renervations and vanadlisms occurred as the centuries
        went onlike in the 1600s where the church would receive the famous 8000 pipe organ. During the French Revolution,
        the building was turned into a food and wine storage with it falling into disrepair. Napoleon Bonepart would later restore
        the building to its former glory which would serve as the place for his coronation as emperor. Surviving two world wars With
        several restorrations before and after, the building would serve as the bulwark of French history. In 2019, a fire spread where
        the cathederal spire and roof was lost but much of the building and treasures was intact. It is closed at the moment for restorrations
        but will soon be open for visitors once again. </p>

      <h2 id="Arc">Arc De Triomphe</h2>
      <p>The building was initially commissioned by Emperor Napoleon Boneparte to celebrate the might of the French army during the time period
        of the Napoleonic wars in 1806. The arch was designed by Jean-François-Thérèse Chalgrin is 164 feet high and 148 feet wide. Constructiion
        began on August 15, 1806, Napoleon's birthday, where work was slow. Especially after the death of the main designer and the abdication of
        and defeat of Napoleon lead to little to no progress made. It was not until 1823 after the successful French invasion of Spain would
        King Louis XVI of France ordered the resumption of the construction. The basic construction was finished in 1830 while the entire landmark
        was finished in 1836. France's tomb of the unknown soldier is located under the arc with the flame of rememberance which has
        burned since 1921 continously burns. This landmark serves as one of the iconic symbols of France where victory parades frequently march past
        whether they were invaders of France or France and its allies.

      <h2 id="Lourve">The Lourve Musuem</h2>
      <p>Originally, the Lourve palace, where the musuem is held, was built as a fortress to protect Paris. Eventually, it became a place wwhere the
        Kings of France would reside during 1528. The king at the time ordered to have the Louvre rebuilt but that work did not start until 1547,
        the reign of Henri II. The museum part had proposals to create a public gallery but none of them could be agreed upon. This would continue
        until the French revolution. When Louis XVI was imprisoned, his personal collection was seized and made national property. This made the
        museum a priority to prevent looting. Years went on and the Lourve received and lost many pieces. The pyramid that it is known for
        was proposed by French President Francois Mitterrand and was built in 1989.
